description: The metrics the console reports for a monitoring system, and the alerts worth setting up.

# Metrics

The console reports the state of Nyktus to a monitoring system such as Prometheus: the queues of events and alerts, the incidents that are not closed, the honeypots by whether a sensor reports for them, and the [periodic tasks](/operate/database#periodic-tasks) of the worker. The worker listens on no port, so the console answers for it; the values come from the database, which all roles share.

## Reading the metrics

In the web console, administrators open Metrics: the page shows every family with its help text, labels and values, and a time next to the metrics that report one. Lines that belong to no family are not shown; read the whole text through the API. It reads the values when it opens and when you choose Refresh, and draws no charts; use your monitoring system for those.

`GET /api/v1/metrics` returns the metrics in the text format of Prometheus, version 0.0.4. Administrators read it with a session, a monitoring system with an [API key](/api/authentication) that carries the scope `metrics:read`. Other roles and keys receive `403`. Whether incidents are open tells an intruder whether they were noticed, so give the scope only to the monitoring system and keep its key in its secret store.

A scrape configuration for Prometheus, with the key in a file:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: nyktus
    scheme: https
    metrics_path: /api/v1/metrics
    authorization:
      type: Bearer
      credentials_file: /etc/prometheus/nyktus-key
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["nyktus.example.com"]
```

Every request reads the database, so scrape at most every 15 seconds; once a minute is enough. Reads are not recorded in the [audit log](/operate/audit-log); a request denied for a missing permission is, as for every route.

## What the metrics report

Every metric is a gauge. Values are aggregates; labels name only a fixed status or the name of a periodic task, never a honeytoken, a honeypot, an incident, a channel, an address or a name. Ages are in seconds, times in seconds since the epoch, and `0` where there is nothing to measure.

| Metric | Labels | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `nyktus_event_jobs` | | Events waiting to be [processed](/guides/incidents). |
| `nyktus_event_jobs_due` | | Of these, the events that are due now. |
| `nyktus_event_jobs_retrying` | | Of these, the events that failed at least once. They are tried again, at the latest every hour, and raise no alert until they are processed; the log names the cause as `incident: event not processed`. |
| `nyktus_event_jobs_oldest_age_seconds` | | Age of the oldest event that waits. |
| `nyktus_alert_deliveries` | `status`: `pending`, `dead` | [Deliveries](/guides/alerting#delivery) of alerts and tests that wait to be sent, and those that [failed for good](/guides/alerting#read-and-retry-deliveries), within the retention. |
| `nyktus_alert_deliveries_oldest_due_age_seconds` | | How long the delivery that has been due longest has waited. |
| `nyktus_incidents` | `status`: `open`, `acknowledged` | Incidents that are not closed. |
| `nyktus_honeypots` | `status`: `never`, `online`, `offline` | Honeypots by their [status](/guides/honeypots#status), disabled ones included. All three values are always reported, also with `0`. |
| `nyktus_periodic_task_last_success_timestamp_seconds` | `task` | When a periodic task last ran to its end. |
| `nyktus_periodic_task_last_failure_timestamp_seconds` | `task` | When a periodic task last failed. |
| `nyktus_periodic_task_last_rows` | `task` | Rows that the last successful run removed or changed. |
| `nyktus_build_info` | `version`, `go_version` | Always `1`; the labels name the version of Nyktus and of Go. |

## Suggested alerts

- **No worker.** `time() - nyktus_periodic_task_last_success_timestamp_seconds{task="delete_expired_sign_in_data"} > 900`: the task runs every five minutes, so no worker has run it for three intervals. Without a worker, events raise no alerts.
- **Events not processed.** `nyktus_event_jobs_oldest_age_seconds > 300` or `nyktus_event_jobs_retrying > 0`: events wait, and their alerts with them.
- **Alerts not delivered.** `nyktus_alert_deliveries{status="dead"} > 0` after a change, or `nyktus_alert_deliveries_oldest_due_age_seconds > 300`: a channel does not accept alerts. [Retry](/guides/alerting#read-and-retry-deliveries) dead deliveries once the channel works.
- **A sensor stopped.** `nyktus_honeypots{status="offline"} > 0`: no sensor has reported for a honeypot in 15 minutes. A honeypot that nobody reaches raises no alert, so this is the only sign that a sensor stopped, lost its connection to the trigger or no longer runs a honeypot. A honeypot that you removed from the sensor stays offline until you delete it in the console. `nyktus_honeypots{status="never"} > 0` for longer than it takes to set up a sensor means that a sensor has not yet reported with the current secret.
- **A periodic task fails.** `nyktus_periodic_task_last_failure_timestamp_seconds > nyktus_periodic_task_last_success_timestamp_seconds`: the log of the worker names the cause as `worker: job failed`.

Monitor the processes themselves, their memory and their connections, with the tools of your platform; Nyktus reports no metrics of the Go runtime.
